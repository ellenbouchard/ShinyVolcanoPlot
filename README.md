# ShinyVolcanoPlot
My own Shiny app for making custom volcano plots. 


My goal is to create an interactive web app for easy volcano plot customization. 
Currently, I have created a basic Shiny app that allows the user to upload a .csv file of their differential expression results, and lets them adjust thresholds, colors, and perform some label customization.

I want to add much more interactivity, in which the user can click on specific genes/data points to change their color or labels, as well as add multiple label layers according to custom gene lists.
